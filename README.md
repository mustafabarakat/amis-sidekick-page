## Overview

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles information.

## Information Collection and Use

The Extension operates locally within the user’s browser and **does not collect, store, transmit, or share personal information externally**.  

Specifically:

- The Extension does not collect personal data.  
- The Extension does not collect financial information.  
- The Extension does not transmit ServiceNow or FPIM data to any external server.  
- The Extension does not use analytics tools or tracking technologies.  
- The Extension does not monitor browsing activity outside authorised organisational systems.  
- The Extension does not sell, rent, or trade any data.  
- The Extension does not use data for advertising, profiling, or tracking purposes.  

### ServiceNow and FPIM Data Handling  

The Extension may **temporarily access or process ServiceNow record data** (such as work order details, case numbers, or field values) **solely to provide the intended functionality**. For example, to automate form filling or extract key values for user display.  

This data is:

- Processed only within the user’s active browser session.  
- Not transmitted to any external or third-party server.  
- Not stored or retained beyond what is required.  

### Local Storage of User Settings  

The Extension may store configuration settings locally in the browser (e.g., feature preferences or UI options) to enable personalised functionality.  

These settings:

- Are stored locally using browser storage.  
- Are not transmitted externally.  
- Do not contain personal information (unless voluntarily entered by the user in configuration fields).  

---

## Data Sharing and Sale

The Extension does not:

- Sell data.  
- Share data with third parties.  
- Transfer data outside the organisation.  
- Use data for tracking or advertising purposes.  

---

## Permissions

The Extension only requests the minimum browser permissions necessary to function within authorised organisational systems (ServiceNow and FPIM).  
These permissions are used exclusively to enable workflow automation features and to temporarily access page content necessary for those functions.

---

## Data Security

Since the Extension operates locally and does not transmit organisational data externally, no user, financial, or workflow data is stored on external servers.  
All ServiceNow and FPIM data processed by the Extension remains within the user’s browser and organisational systems.

---

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated if the Extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will reflect current data handling practices.
